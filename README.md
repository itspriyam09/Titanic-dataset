# Titanic-dataset
Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster ðŸš¢

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project is based on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, where the goal is to build a predictive model to determine whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, class, and more.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset contains details about passengers aboard the Titanic, including:

PassengerId â€“ Unique ID for each passenger

Survived â€“ Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

Pclass â€“ Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)

Name, Sex, Age â€“ Personal details

SibSp, Parch â€“ Number of relatives aboard

Ticket, Fare â€“ Ticket information
Cabin, Embarked â€“ Cabin and port details


ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and trends

Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables

Build and evaluate classification models to predict survival

Compare different machine learning models


ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost)

Jupyter Notebook for analysis


ðŸ“Š Approach

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handling missing values in Age, Cabin, and Embarked
Encoding categorical variables

Feature scaling (if required)



2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizing survival rates based on gender, class, and age

Checking correlations between features



3. Model Building & Evaluation

Tried different models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost

Evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score

Performed Hyperparameter tuning forÂ betterÂ results
